                    <p>
                        {{name}} is a simple-to-use URL shortening service. It's <b>completely free</b> for <i>everyone</i> to use. I don't
                        impose service fees, and never will.

                <div class="container">
                    <h1>How do I shorten my URL?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Just paste it into the first box, click the button that says <b>shorten</b>, and get the shortened link {{name}} generated by
                        clicking the box beneath it. It's as simple as that! The shortened URL is case sensitive, so pay attention when you're
                        typing it out, or else it won't work!
                    </p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h1>What's an alias?</h1>
                    <p>
                        An alias is a a shortened URL with a customized id. The part after the slash is a key that points to your URL. This part
                        of the URL may be difficult to remember. It's recommended you get an alias for your URL if you're planning to use it a
                        lot.
                    </p>

                <div class="container">
                    <h1>Will {{name}} stay up all the time?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Close all the time (around 98%). {{name}} goes to sleep after half an hour of inactivity, and this is the reason
                        that you may experience an increased load time when it first wakes up again. To get rid of this limitation, I'd need to
                        upgrade my plan for <a href="https://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. This will need some <i>money</i>, something
                        I do not have much of. I would like to keep {{name}} up as much as possible for everyone to use, but this is simply not
                        possible without support. You can help me cover the expenses by donating to me on
                        <a href="https://paypal.me/ifvictr" target="_blank">PayPal</a>. Any amount can help, even the amount you'd need to buy
                        just <b>a bag of chips</b>!

                    <h1>Does this service contain any ads?</h1>
                    <p>
                        No, not <i>yet</i>. I don't want to resort to placing ads, but will do if not enough donations are being made. The
                        end-user's experience is the last thing I'd want to trade off.
