                    <h1>What is {{name}}?</h1>
                    <p>
                        {{name}} is a simple-to-use URL shortening service. It's <b>completely free</b> for <i>everyone</i> to use. I don't
                        impose service fees, and never will.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <h1>How does it work?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Just paste your super-long URL into the first box, click the button that says <b>shorten</b>, and get the shortened
                        link {{name}} generated by clicking the box beneath it. It's as simple as that!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container">
                    <h1>Will {{name}} stay up all the time?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Close all the time (around 98%). {{name}} goes to sleep after half an hour of inactivity, and this is the reason
                        that you may experience an increased load time when it first wakes up again. To get rid of this limitation, I'd need to
                        upgrade my plan for <a href="https://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>. This will need some <i>money</i>, something
                        I do not have much of. I would like to keep {{name}} up as much as possible for everyone to use, but this is simply not
                        possible without support. You can help me cover the expenses by donating to me on
                        <a href="https://paypal.me/ifvictr" target="_blank">PayPal</a>. Any amount can help, even the amount you'd need to buy
                        just <b>a bag of chips</b>!

                    <p>
                        No, not <i>yet</i>. I don't want to resort to placing ads, but will do if not enough donations are being made. The
                        end-user's experience is the last thing I'd want to trade off.
